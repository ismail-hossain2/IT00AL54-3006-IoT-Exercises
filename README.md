This repository contains my solutions for the course:

**IT00AL54-3006 Internet of Things**

All exercises are organized according to the structure provided in the course materials.

## Structure

- `1_HelloWorld` – Basic serial communication and counter
- `2_Diode` – LED blinking (0.5s ON, 2s OFF)
- `3_DiodeFade` – PWM brightness control and fading
- `4_Button` – Button input and toggle logic

Each folder contains a `sketch.ino` file with the corresponding solution.

## Notes

- Where required, non-blocking techniques (e.g. `millis()`) are used.
